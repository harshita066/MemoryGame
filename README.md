## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

How to play:
Just simply start the game by clicking on the any card and the timer will start.
How many moves did you made will be counted as well.
There is a reset button to reset the game.


The javascript contains all the functionality for the game to work.

There are two arrays
    1. cards: holds each card symbol
    2. openedCards: as the user open the cards those cards are store there.

There are various functions performing specific tasks.
Functions: 
    1. clean() : To clean all the #text nodes.
    2. shuffle() : For Shuffling cards.
    3. resetGame() : For reseting the game.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
